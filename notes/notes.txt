[x]: correct the current subfigure fiasco in icml. additive_faithful.tex
[ ]: update appendix.tex

We need to prove 
Risk(missing-one additive) - Risk(full additive) > norm(missing component)

Need assumptions:
* Full independence
* Must subtract out mean of f_0(X) from optimization
* ...

We can either input de-meaned Y into the algorithm.
Or we can add an additional centering term in the optimization

EDIT NOTE:

Right now, $\mathcal{C}_0[s,b,B,L]$ is the $\epsilon$-cover. 
Need to replace _0 with _\epsilon

Sometimes, \mathcal{C}^s[b,B,L] represent set of additive convex functions, 
replace with C[s,b,B,L]

sparsistency.tex: called restricted regression --> called THE restricted
					n-dimensional change, \mathbf{1}_n

* Correct proof mistakes in the Additive Faithfulness section.
* Download and try ICML format.
