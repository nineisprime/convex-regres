\section{Discussion}

We have introduced a framework for estimating high dimensional but
sparse convex functions.  Because of the special properties of
convexity, variable selection for convex functions enjoys additive
faithfulness---it suffices to carry out variable selection over an
additive model, in spite of the approximation error this introduces.
Sparse convex additive models can be optimized using block coordinate
quadratic programming, which we have found to be effective and
scalable.  We established variable selection consistency results,
allowing exponential scaling in the ambient dimension.  We expect
that the technical assumptions we have used in these analyses can be
weakened; this is one direction for future work.  Another interesting
direction for building this work is to allow for additive models that
are a combination of convex and concave components.  If the
convexity/concavity of each component function is known, this again
results in a convex program.  The challenge is to develop a method to
automatically detect the concavity or convexity pattern of the
variables.
