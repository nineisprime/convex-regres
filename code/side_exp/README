New Implementation of SCAM_MOSEK

I attempted to eliminate the "beta" variables in optimization.
Learn only function values "f" or "z". I enforced that the discrete 2nd derivative must be positive.

The new optimization is strangely slower because it has about twice as fewer variables and it has only one equality constraint. It does sometimes find a better solution, i.e., a solution that lowers the objective. 

MOSEK sometimes returns incorrect solution for the new optimization.

Experiment:
The code for the new optimization is "SCAM_MOSEK_f" in the "SCAM_QP.m" file. The script "variable_selection_script.m" contains the code that runs the comparison.
